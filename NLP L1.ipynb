Jobs, who has played a key role in Apple's success in past years, recently appeared visibly thin at a product conference, raising questions about his health. As soon as word of this news hit the internet, it started circulating across all social media platforms. Within the first hour of trading, Apple stocks lost 10% of its value (Nearly 5 billion dollars), and all of this was caused by an 18 year old posting an unsubstantiated rumor to CNN's Ireport website [1].The Apple shares fell sharply after an erroneous Web report saying founder and CEO Steve Jobs had suffered a heart attack. Shares quickly recovered after it became clear the rumor was not true. The posting, made on iReport, a user-generated content site run by CNN, said, \"Jobs was rushed to the ER just a few hours ago after suffering a major heart attack,\" according to a blog that took a screenshot of the posting.Apple's stock fell 10% in 10 minutes, then recovered to trade flat most of the session before closing 3% lower.An Apple ( ) spokesman confirmed the rumor was not true, but declined to comment as to whether the company is taking any further action.While CNN clearly states the content on iReport is unedited and unfiltered, the false report also raises questions as to the credibility of user-generated content, and how much traditional media outlets should embrace such formats. Expertise said user-generated content, while obviously not perfect, does result in a lot of good stories and that the mainstream media shouldn't shy away from the growing medium.This case study shows that even the smallest rumors can grow and mutate and can cause untold damage to the largest, most established organization's reputation.InterpretationA rumor is a talk or opinion widely disseminated with no discernible source or a statement or report currently without known authority for its truth. A rumor is the opposite of fact. A data is a piece of confirmed information, while a rumor is unconfirmed information that has no evidence of any data. Since rumors do not support any data, they are usually exaggerated information and may be far from the truth.As in the given case study above, the rumor that subsequently made Apple stock fall 10% just within ten minutes was about the CEO of Apple company being hospitalized after having a heart attack. The source of the rumor was an online tabloid newspaper. The rumor was false. However, due to the celebrity status of Mr. Steve Jobs, it was able to attract a massive audience.In the a rumor involves a form of a statement whose veracity is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of    and communication studies have widely varying definitions of rumor. Rumors are also often discussed with regard to \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government). Rumors thus have often been viewed as particular forms of other communication concepts.In normal business situations, rumors are typically between 75% and 95% correct. But the more correct a rumor is, the more dangerous it becomes. Eminently believable rumors invite greater buy-in, which translates to more people who are exposed to the incorrect, and often damaging, part of the rumor. But not all rumors are alike and not all rumors are inherently bad.Link between Rumor and ReputationThe reputation of an organization is the way of how it’s stakeholders think about the organization in different aspects. If they have a positive impact towards those categories, the organization can maintain a good reputation [10].Organizational reputation depends on the quality of the products and services, how it treats employees, how it gives the value to its customers, history and financial stability. Keeping a good reputation is one of the most important factors for an IT company. Clients want to get the service from a well reputed organization since it ensures the final product or service may fulfill the client’s requirements. Hence, for keeping the customers and expanding the customer network company should maintain the reputation while growing it.Rumor is unverified information about the organization which is transmitted through informal channels [10]. Rumors can be true or false or halfly true. Most of the rumors spread in the community via mouth to mouth or social media. Rumors are spreading as a virus, faster and easier than ever before thanks to modern technology. Rumors are not officially confirmed information. Even though rumors can be positive or negative. Positive rumors affect the company in a positive manner while negative rumors affect the company.Negative rumors are something bad about the company. Then the stakeholders will start to keep bad opinion towards the company and it can vanish the company reputation while losing the customers. Positive rumors are something satisfactory about the company.When spread such kind of rumor stakeholders start to attract more towards the company while expanding the reputation.Hence, rumors can happen with IT companies in the above manner. These rumors can lead to vanishing or expanding its reputation. By this way rumors are directly or indirectly and positively or negatively linked with the reputation of the company.Positive and Negative effect of RumorsMost rumors involve sharing who did what with whom. This is not always negative. Some other functions of gossip are to get or give advice about how to navigate a social situation. Rumors also do not only or always involve an absent third person. It is possible to make a rumor about oneself. For example, a person might strategically share information about oneself to bolster one’s status or appeal. Positive rumors include prosocial behaviours that increase group cooperation and decrease selfishness. Rumors strengthen social bonds and help to resolve conflicts. It informs us about social norms. Not all rumors cause harm, and most of the time, it is neutral.Effects of positive Rumors:establish, develop, and maintain relationships with otherscreate strong group bondsdefine social status within the grouplearn how to behave sociallyresolve conflictsinfluence othersRumors are also a useful ‘political tool’ in organisations/institutions or social structures where people are competing for status or are attempting to remove someone out of a social group. Negative rumors are cringe-worthy. It is tantalizing. It is destructive. Think Dangerous Liaisons but with high-tech devices instead of couriers and quills. We know it when we hear it, and we know it when we are the ones spreading it. This widespread bad habit can also be used as a bullying tactic where rumours are spread in organisations, families or more widely, on social media. Examples of negative rumors include spreading malicious rumours or adding to the truth in a negative way that can benefit the individual doing the rumoring.Effects of negative Rumors:Makes us believe in liesTears apart the friendshipsDisrespectDamage the reputationAnxiety/ Depressionfear and uncertaintyWaste of timeRumors effect on the professionsAt the point when rumours about us begin in the working environment, they can extraordinarily impact our professional lives. Here are a couple of manners by which rumours can affect us on the expert level. It will decrease inspiration as a worker in the workplace. At the point when individuals begin discussing bogus things in regards to us at work, we lose the will to execute our official assignments. It becomes more enthusiastic consistently to stroll in our office. We feel terrible about the picture the rumours have made and we think that it's difficult to get in the state of mind of accomplishing work. It might lessen the profitability of the influenced individual.Rumours divert us from carrying out our responsibility since our psyche continues concentrating on what individuals are stating about us as opposed to concentrating on our work. We invest important energy shielding our position, time we ought to spend accomplishing our work. We may not get an opportunity to clarify our position particularly if the level of leadership is excessively long and we are not legitimately answering to the top administration. Sometimes, it will force the employee to resign. Because of the rumours, our professionals' notoriety may have gotten completely defaced and the circumstance may have gotten so crazy that it is highly unlikely for us to present our renunciation.Despite the fact that we could be surrendering our preferred vocation, yet so as to flee from the bits of gossip and for a crisp starting we conclude it is simpler to leave and desert everything.Affect on IT industryRumors can spread in any workplace environment. People have an appetite to discuss the lives of others. However, rumors can damage reputations, waste time, create division, promote anxiety, and negatively impact employee morale within an organization. Rumors usually start when people try to fill in the blanks with their own interpretations of a given circumstance. This can quickly get out of hand, as new details are added to the facts, making it hard to tell apart the story from the truth.Here are five rumors that affect the IT industry that could kill the business workflow as what happens to the Apple market in 2008.Rumors exist for all kinds of reasons. They can be a source of diversion or they can validate and support a point of view. They can be a way to get attention, to manipulate a situation or to reconcile one's psychological state with what one sees as actually going on. But most of the time, ambiguity causes rumors; people are just trying to fill in the informational gaps.There are three types of rumours that affect to the IT organization, as follows:pipe-dream rumours, as rumours that lead to wishful thinkingbogy rumours, as those that increase anxiety or fearwedge-driving rumours, like those that generate hatred.Dealing with rumorsRumors are often created between/around people who are known to each other by personal experience or to the public due to their celebrity status. In this sense, a rumor could either be positive or negative to the reputation of the person whom the rumor is about. In any of the cases, there are certain ways that could be used when dealing with rumors and such actions should be executed with wit since one’s stature is a delicate matter.Being prepared: An average person may experience a rumor being spread in his social circle about him at least once in his lifetime. Since it’s rather a folly in human nature to poke around others’ business than minding his/her own, being prepared to face such situations is common sense.Ex: After the Easter Sunday attacks happened in April 2019, lots of rumors may they be true or false-started to spread about Muslim culture and Islam. In this case, the Sri Lankan government was anticipating rumor waves and prepared for an upcoming public outrage which could only do more harm than any good to the situation of the country.Taking prompt action: As mentioned above, hearsay can either be degrading or enhancing one’s repute. If the rumor is devaluing one’s social image, then it’s better to take necessary actions to suppress the rumor. If the grapevine is actually beneficial to uplift someone’s social stature, in such cases, the related party may just turn a blind eye or humbly put an end to it, if necessary.Ex: During the turbulent time in Sri Lanka in 2019, Sri Lankan government took several actions to stop the damaging hearsays about the Muslim community being circulated around the country. Taking legal actions against those who spread false rumors on social media, and then putting a temporary ban on all social media for internet users in Sri Lanka were such steps taken to repress the rumors.Get and keep on message: In order to clear a hearsay, the affected party may state whether the circulated message is true or false.Ex: During the first few months of Covid-19 started to spread all around the world, Chinese and Russian state media used their arabic channels to spread the rumor that the virus was a biological weapon created and released by America to debilitate and conquer the world[3]. The United States of America strongly refuted the allegations and the U.S president Mr. Donald Trump accused China for having a ‘history of infecting the world and running substandard laboratories’[4].Minimizing the scope and misunderstanding: When it comes to dealing with rumors, if there is anything that’s not true which would aggravate the misunderstanding, then it is advisable to minimize the scope and misunderstanding by explaining what actually took place.Ex: During Lakme Fashion Week in 2009[5], Mrs. Twinkle Khanna unbuttoned her husband , Mr. Akshay Kumar’s pants. A social worker filed a complaint against the couple and the event organizers for the ‘obscenity’[5].Mrs. Twinkle Khanna explained on the popular Indian talk show ‘Koffee with Karan’ regarding what actually happened, answering to the public talk.Taking responsibility: If there is some truth in the talk that is spreading, the related party may take responsibility for what is true. This action may further create an approving impression since the alleged party approaches the audience with honesty.Ex: When Airbnb was accused of racism and discrimination back in 2016, the CEO of the company apologized for their slow response for the accusations and introduced new tools and policies to prevent such inconveniences in the future[6].Making restitution: If the alleged party of the rumor owns responsibility for their actions, seeing truth in the circulated hearsay, they may compensate for the damages caused by their deed(s). Taking these types of measures will lessen the unfavorable impression caused by the rumor regarding the affected person or entity.Ex: In 2011, when SONY was the victim of a large data breach, personal information of more than 70 million PlayStation was leaked. The CEO of SONY personally apologized to the users acknowledging the damage caused. The users were given a free month of PlayStation Plus and identity theft insurance as a compensation[7].Calling in cavalry: When responding to a rumor, the related party can involve another third party whose testimonials are accepted and respected by the society. Taking such measures can help with clarifying the rumor, providing much apprehension and insight into the matter.Ex: In 2019, Fonterra Company was accused of their Anchor milk products having DCD (Dicyandiamide) residues. However the company strongly refuted the allegations and stated that, “in Sri Lanka the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), The Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), The National Institute of Health Science (NIHS) and the Sri Lanka Standard Institute (SLSI), each carry out independent tests on the milk powder that we import into the country”, indicating that it was impossible for the Anchor milk powder products to have such harmful agents[8].Being cautious about lawsuits: The affected party of a damaging public talk can take the matter into the court in order to completely suppress the source or the creator(s) of the rumor. In this sense, the guilty party is ordered to pay a huge sum of money as the compensation for the damages caused. However, when giving the matter into legal hands, one should be extremely cautious since, if the suspected source of the rumor is not found guilty, such a situation can also be newsworthy for the media, inflicting much damage on related parties’ reputation.Ex: In 2019, Australian actor, Geoffrey Rush sued a tabloid newspaper ‘Rupert Murdoch’s Nationwide News’ for wrongly portraying him as having behaved inappropriately with a female co-star. The actor won the legal battle and was awarded 2.9 million Australian dollars for the damages caused by the defamation[9].Create a good rumorTo sway public opinion, rumors have been used by ordinary people, the media, and even governments. Rumors can be harmful or harmless and they can spread and get out of control. It's always important to carefully consider the possible consequences before spreading a rumor and the impact of rumor. In order to create the good as well as right rumor, the creator needs to have a correct goal in mind while he/she makes it up.Rumors are made memorable by being simple, making concrete references, using stereotypical phrases and utilizing humor.The Successful Rumor,easy to remember.follows a stereotyped plot.a function of the momentary interests and circumstances of the group.exploits the emotions and sentiments of the group.Information should be gathered prior to designing a rumor for a specific group, including:What kinds of information the group is eager for.What information the group already has and what it lacks.The current fears, hopes and hostilities the group already has.The customary and traditional ways the group deals with those fears, hopes and hostilities.Spreading the rumor:Design different rumors that reveal the same information.Plant such rumors in different suitable places.Design them so as to appear as of independent origin.ReferenceCase study [ONLINE] Available at:  (Accessed 13 July 2020)How to create a good rumor: ContributionSlides1.
