1. Cleaning the words is often called preprocessing, and that is the focus of Word cloud.

Word clouds are a useful way to visualize text data because they make understanding word frequencies easier. Words that appear more frequently within the email text appear larger in the cloud. Word Clouds make it easy to identify “key words.”

2. Project 2: Spam Detection

This is a binary classification problem since an email can either be spam (1) or not spam (0). build a machine learneing model that can identify whether or not an email is spam. going to use the Python library Scikit-Learn to explore tokenization, vectorization, and statistical classification algorithms.
